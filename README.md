# mondrian

A framework for creating browser-based interactive artwork in ClojureScript.  mondrian is unique in that it encourages exploratory, interactive development of your art projects.  You start with a blank canvas and then gradually add state and rendering components until you have realized your vision.

You can also just write a bunch of code and reload the web page, but I find that the REPL-oriented flow is a lot more fun.

I used mondrian to create *[La vie en cloj][]*, my collection of browser-based art demos.  The first such demo, [Epitrochoids in ClojureScript][], is described in an article on my blog.
